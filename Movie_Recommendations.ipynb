    "I chose to build the recommender system using the MovieLens dataset with a collaborative filtering approach, specifically using a model based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find movies similar to the one a user inputs. I started by extracting the data, ratings.csv and movies.csv, and loading them into pandas DataFrames. Then I merged the ratings and movies DataFrames to associate movie titles with their ratings. Then, I created a pivot table (user-movie matrix) with movie titles as rows, user IDs as columns, and ratings as values. Missing ratings were filled with 0, indicating that the user hasn't rated that movie. Since the user-movie matrix is mostly zeros, I converted it into a sparse matrix using SciPy's csr_matrix. Next I created a KNN model with cosine similarity as the distance metric. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, in this case, the ratings vectors of two movies. A smaller angle (and thus, a higher cosine similarity) indicates that the movies are similar in terms of user ratings. Then I fitted the KNN model on the sparse matrix representing the user-movie matrix. \n",

    "I created a function (recommend_movies) that takes a movie title as input and uses the trained KNN model to find the nearest neighbors (most similar movies) based on cosine similarity of ratings. The function returns a list of recommended movie titles, excluding the input movie. As a test, I used the function to recommend ten movies similar to \"Toy Story (1995),\" resulting in a list of movies that users who liked \"Toy Story\" also enjoyed. In summary, the recommender system leverages user ratings to find and recommend movies similar to a user's input. This approach assumes that movies with similar rating patterns by users are likely to be similar in content or appeal, making them good recommendations. The key to this system is the collaborative filtering technique, which focuses on finding relationships between items (movies) based on user interactions rather than the content of the items themselves."
