# ALS Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of ALS patient data using clustering techniques to discover meaningful patterns that could assist in medical analysis. The primary objective is to determine the optimal number of clusters using the K-means algorithm and visualize the data through PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for better understanding and insight extraction.

## Features
- **Data Standardization**: Ensures all features contribute equally, improving the performance of the clustering algorithm.
- **Silhouette Score**: Utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters, maximizing the separation between clusters while maintaining cohesion within.
- **PCA Visualization**: Reduces dimensionality for easier data visualization and interpretation.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `ALS_Data_Analysis.ipynb` to view the analysis.

## Conclusions
The analysis reveals two distinct clusters, suggesting specific patterns in ALS patient data that could be crucial for further medical research or operational adjustments in patient care strategies.

## Future Work
- Validation of clustering results with external clinical data.
- Exploration of additional clustering algorithms for comparison.
- In-depth analysis of cluster characteristics to understand patient segmentation better.

# Movie Recommendations

## Overview
This project develops a movie recommendation system based on user ratings collected from a dataset. Using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with cosine similarity, the system identifies movies similar to a user's tastes, enhancing the movie-watching experience by personalized suggestions.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements a user-item rating system to predict preferences based on similar user interactions.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movie ratings to find the closest matches.
- **Sparse Matrix**: Efficiently handles large datasets by storing non-zero data points in the user-movie rating matrix.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Execute the Jupyter Notebook `Movie_Recommendations.ipynb` to see the recommendation system in action.

## Output
The system outputs a list of movie recommendations based on the input movie title, demonstrating similar user ratings and preferences.

## Future Work
- Enhance the recommendation algorithm by incorporating more complex similarity measures.
- Expand the dataset to include more user ratings for a broader recommendation scope.
- Implement a front-end interface for easier user interaction with the recommendation system.
