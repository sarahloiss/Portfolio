# ALS Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of ALS patient data using clustering techniques to discover meaningful patterns that could assist in medical analysis. The primary objective is to determine the optimal number of clusters using the K-means algorithm and visualize the data through PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for better understanding and insight extraction.

## Features
- **Data Standardization**: Ensures all features contribute equally, improving the performance of the clustering algorithm.
- **Silhouette Score**: Utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters, maximizing the separation between clusters while maintaining cohesion within.
- **PCA Visualization**: Reduces dimensionality for easier data visualization and interpretation.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `ALS_Data_Analysis.ipynb` to view the analysis.

## Conclusions
The analysis reveals two distinct clusters, suggesting specific patterns in ALS patient data that could be crucial for further medical research or operational adjustments in patient care strategies.

## Future Work
- Validation of clustering results with external clinical data.
- Exploration of additional clustering algorithms for comparison.
- In-depth analysis of cluster characteristics to understand patient segmentation better.
